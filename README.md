Google API Extensions for Java (GAX Java) is a library which aids in the
development of client libraries for server APIs, based on [GRPC](http://grpc.io)
and Google API conventions.

Application code will rarely need to use most of the classes within this
library directly, but code generated automatically from the API definition
files can use services such as paged list iteration, request batching, and
polling of long-running operations to provide a more convenient and idiomatic
API surface to callers.

Currently, this library shouldn't be used independently from google-cloud-java, otherwise there is
a high risk of diamond dependency problems, because google-cloud-java uses beta features from this
library which can change in breaking ways between versions. See [VERSIONING](#versioning) for
more information.

Quickstart
----------

If you are using Maven, add this to your pom.xml file
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.api</groupId>
  <artifactId>gax</artifactId>
  <version>1.31.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.api</groupId>
  <artifactId>gax-grpc</artifactId>
  <version>1.31.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, add this to your dependencies

```Groovy
compile 'com.google.api:gax:1.31.0',
  'com.google.api:gax-grpc:1.31.0'
```

If you are using SBT, add this to your dependencies

```Scala
libraryDependencies += "com.google.api" % "gax" % "1.31.0"
libraryDependencies += "com.google.api" % "gax-grpc" % "1.31.0"
```

Java Versions
-------------

Java 7 or above is required for using this library.

Contributing
------------

Contributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.

See the [CONTRIBUTING] documentation for more information on how to get started.

Versioning
----------

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), but with some
additional qualifications:

1. Components marked with `@BetaApi` are considered to be "0.x" features inside
   a "1.x" library. This means they can change between minor and patch releases
   in incompatible ways. These features should not be used by any library "B"
   that itself has consumers, unless the components of library B that use
   `@BetaApi` features are also marked with `@BetaApi`. Features marked as
   `@BetaApi` are on a path to eventually become "1.x" features with the marker
   removed.

   **Special exception for google-cloud-java**: google-cloud-java is
   allowed to depend on `@BetaApi` features without declaring the consuming
   code `@BetaApi`, because gax-java and google-cloud-java move in step
   with each other. For this reason, gax-java should not be used
   independently of google-cloud-java.

1. Components marked with `@InternalApi` are technically public, but are only
   public for technical reasons, because of the limitations of Java's access
   modifiers. For the purposes of semver, they should be considered private.

1. Components marked with `@InternalExtensionOnly` are stable for usage, but
   not for extension. Thus, methods will not be removed from interfaces marked
   with this annotation, but methods can be added, thus breaking any
   code implementing the interface. See the javadocs for more details on other
   consequences of this annotation.

### Submodule notes

- `gax` is stable (>= 1.0.0), so anything not marked `@BetaApi`, `@InternalApi`,
or `@InternalExtensionOnly` won't break between minor releases. Anything marked
`@InternalExtensionOnly` can only break extensions between minor releases.
- `gax-grpc` is stable (>= 1.0.0), so anything not marked `@BetaApi`, `@InternalApi`,
or `@InternalExtensionOnly` won't break between minor releases. Anything marked
`@InternalExtensionOnly` can only break extensions between minor releases.
- `gax-httpjson` is beta (0.x.y), so anything may change at any time and the public
API should not be considered stable. There is no difference whether a class is
marked `@BetaApi` or not; that annotation is only present as a reminder. There is
also no difference whether a class is marked `@InternalExtensionOnly` or not; that
only implies that the annotation will still be present in 1.0.0.

### Feature notes

- **Long Running Operations** - This feature is not yet considered stable.
- **Streaming** - Streaming features are not yet considered stable.
- **Batching** - Batching features are not yet considered stable.
- **Generated Code Support** - Features to support generated code is not yet
  considered stable.
- **Testing** - There are no plans to consider any code in the testlib jar to be stable.
