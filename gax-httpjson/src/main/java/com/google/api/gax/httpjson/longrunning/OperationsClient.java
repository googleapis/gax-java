/**
 * Service Description: Manages long-running operations with an API service.
 *
 * <p>When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed to return
 * [Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] to the client, and the client can use this interface to
 * receive the real response asynchronously by polling the operation resource, or pass the operation
 * resource to another API (such as Google Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response. Any API
 * service that returns long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface so
 * developers can have a consistent client experience.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (OperationsClient operationsClient = OperationsClient.create()) {
 *   String name = "name3373707";
 *   Operation response = operationsClient.getOperation(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: close() needs to be called on the OperationsClient object to clean up resources such as
 * threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * <p>The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A "flattened" method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   <li>A "request object" method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   <li>A "callable" method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * <p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * <p>This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of OperationsSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * <p>To customize credentials:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * OperationsSettings operationsSettings =
 *     OperationsSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * OperationsClient operationsClient = OperationsClient.create(operationsSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * OperationsSettings operationsSettings =
 *     OperationsSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * OperationsClient operationsClient = OperationsClient.create(operationsSettings);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
