 * {@code GrpcDirectServerStreamingCallable} creates server-streaming gRPC calls.

 * <p>In a chain of {@link ServerStreamingCallable}s this is the innermost callable. It wraps a
 * {@link ClientCall} in a {@link StreamController} and the downstream {@link ResponseObserver} in a
 * {@link ClientCall.Listener}. This forms a bidirectional bridge between gax & grpc. This is
 * implemented on top of {@link ClientCall.Listener} because {@link
