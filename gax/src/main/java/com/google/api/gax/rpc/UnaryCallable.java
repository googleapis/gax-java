/**
 * A UnaryCallable is an immutable object which is capable of making RPC calls to non-streaming API
 * methods.
 *
 * <p>In typical usage, the request to send to the remote service will not be bound to the
 * UnaryCallable, but instead is provided at call time, which allows for a UnaryCallable to be saved
 * and used indefinitely.
 *
 * <p>There are two styles of calls that can be made through a UnaryCallable: synchronous and
 * asynchronous.
 *
 * <p>Synchronous example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * RequestType request = RequestType.newBuilder().build();
 * UnaryGrpcCallable<RequestType, ResponseType> unaryCallable = api.doSomethingCallable();
 * ResponseType response = unaryCallable.call();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Asynchronous example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * RequestType request = RequestType.newBuilder().build();
 * UnaryGrpcCallable<RequestType, ResponseType> unaryCallable = api.doSomethingCallable();
 * ApiFuture<ResponseType> resultFuture = unaryCallable.futureCall();
 * // do other work
 * // ...
 * ResponseType response = resultFuture.get();
 * }</pre>
