/**
 * A callable that generates Server Streaming attempts. At any one time, it is responsible for at
 * most a single outstanding attempt. During an attempt, it proxies all incoming message to the
 * outer {@link ResponseObserver} and the {@link StreamResumptionStrategy}. Once the attempt
 * completes, the external {@link RetryingFuture} future is notified. If the {@link RetryingFuture}
 * decides to retry the attempt, it will invoke {@link #call()}.
 *
 * <p>The lifecycle of this class is:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The caller instantiates this class.
 *   <li>The caller sets the {@link RetryingFuture} via {@link #setExternalFuture(RetryingFuture)}.
 *       The {@link RetryingFuture} will be responsible for scheduling future attempts.
 *   <li>The caller calls {@link #start()}. This notifies the outer {@link ResponseObserver} that
 *       call is about to start.
 *   <li>The outer {@link ResponseObserver} configures inbound flow control via the {@link
 *       StreamController} that it received in {@link ResponseObserver#onStart(StreamController)}.
 *   <li>The attempt call is sent via the inner/upstream {@link ServerStreamingCallable}.
 *   <li>A future representing the end state of the inner attempt is passed to the outer {@link
 *       RetryingFuture}.
 *   <li>All messages received from the inner {@link ServerStreamingCallable} are recorded by the
 *       {@link StreamResumptionStrategy}.
 *   <li>All messages received from the inner {@link ServerStreamingCallable} are forwarded to the
 *       outer {@link ResponseObserver}.
 *   <li>Upon attempt completion (either success or failure) are communicated to the outer {@link
 *       RetryingFuture}.
 *   <li>If the {@link RetryingFuture} decides to resume the RPC, it will invoke {@link #call()},
 *       which will consult the {@link StreamResumptionStrategy} for the resuming request and
 *       restart the process at step 5.
 *   <li>Once the {@link RetryingFuture} decides to stop the retry loop, it will notify the outer
 *       {@link ResponseObserver}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>This class is meant to be used as middleware between an outer {@link ResponseObserver} and an
 * inner {@link ServerStreamingCallable}. As such it follows the general threading model of {@link
 * ServerStreamingCallable}s:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code onStart} must be called in the same thread that invoked {@code call()}
 *   <li>The outer {@link ResponseObserver} can call {@code request()} and {@code cancel()} on this
 *       class' {@link StreamController} from any thread
 *   <li>The inner callable will serialize calls to {@code onResponse()}, {@code onError()} and
 *       {@code onComplete}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>With this model in mind, this class only needs to synchronize access data that is shared
 * between: the outer {@link ResponseObserver} (via this class' {@link StreamController}) and the
 * inner {@link ServerStreamingCallable}: pendingRequests, cancellationCause and the current
 * innerController.
 *
 * <p>Package-private for internal use.
