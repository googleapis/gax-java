/**
 * A blocking Iterable-style wrapper around server stream responses.
 *
 * <p>This class asynchronously pulls responses from upstream via {@link
 * StreamController#request(int)} and exposes them via its Iterator. The implementation is back
 * pressure aware and uses a constant buffer of 1 item.
 *
 * <p>Please note that the stream can only be consumed once and must either be fully consumed or be
 * canceled.
 *
 * <p>Neither this class nor the iterator it returns is thread-safe.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * ServerStream<Item> stream = ...;
 *
 * for (Item item : stream) {
 *   System.out.println(item.id());
 *
 *   // Allow for early termination
 *   if (item.id().equals("needle")) {
 *     // Cancelling the stream will cause `hasNext()` to return false on the next iteration,
 *     // naturally breaking the loop.
 *     stream.cancel();
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <V> The type of each response.
