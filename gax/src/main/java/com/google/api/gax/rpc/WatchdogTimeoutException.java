/**
 * The marker exception thrown when a timeout is exceeded.
 *
 * <p>This error can be thrown under 2 circumstances:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A wait timeout has exceeded, which means that the client timed out waiting for the next
 *       message from the server. In this case, {@link #isRetryable()} will be true.
 *   <li>An idle timeout has exceeded, which means that the stream is using manual flow control and
 *       the caller has not called {@link StreamController#request(int)} (in case of callback api)
 *       or next on {@link ServerStream#iterator()} (in case of blocking api).
