 * Executor, and sequentially such that no two will ever be running at the same time.
 *
 * <p>Tasks submitted to {@link #execute(Runnable)} are executed in FIFO order.
 *
 * <p>The execution of tasks is done by one thread as long as there are tasks left in the queue.
 * When a task is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}, execution of subsequent tasks
 * continues. See {@link QueueWorker#workOnQueue} for details.
 *
 * <p>{@code RuntimeException}s thrown by tasks are simply logged and the executor keeps trucking.
 * If an {@code Error} is thrown, the error will propagate and execution will stop until it is
 * restarted by a call to {@link #execute}.
