/**
 * Mediates message flow between two {@link ResponseObserver}s. It is intended for situations when a
 * stream needs to be transformed in such a way where the incoming responses do not map 1:1 to the
 * output responses.
 *
 * <p>This class manages back pressure between M upstream responses and N downstream responses. It
 * buffers responses when M &gt; N and spools them when M &lt; N. The downstream responses will be
 * delivered via either the upstream thread or the downstream thread that called request(); in
 * either case, the downstream methods will be invoked sequentially. Neither the downstream {@link
 * ResponseObserver} nor the {@link Reframer} need to be threadsafe.
 *
 * <p>All invocations to the {@link Reframer} are made while holding a lock.
 *
 * <p>Expected usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *  class OuterStreamingCallable extends ServerStreamingCallable<Request, FullResponse> {
 *    private final ServerStreamingCallable<Request, Chunk> innerCallable;
 *
 *    OuterStreamingCallable(ServerStreamingCallable<Request, Chunk> innerCallable) {
