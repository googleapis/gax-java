/**
 * A ServerStreamingCallable that implements resumable retries.
 *
 * <p>Wraps a request, a {@link ResponseObserver} and an inner {@link ServerStreamingCallable} and
 * coordinates retries between them. When the inner callable throws an error, this class will
 * schedule retries using the configured {@link ScheduledRetryingExecutor}.
 *
 * <p>Streams can be resumed using a {@link StreamResumptionStrategy}. The {@link
 * StreamResumptionStrategy} is notified of incoming responses and is expected to track the progress
 * of the stream. Upon receiving an error, the {@link StreamResumptionStrategy} is asked to modify
 * the original request to resume the stream.
 *
 * <p>Package-private for internal use.
